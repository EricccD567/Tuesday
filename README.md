## Description

Tuesday is a modern task management system that takes productivity to the next level.
It allows users (task masters) to add team members and create tasks seamlessly.
Unlike other task management systems, our built-in self-reflection system provides daily analytical feedback and personalised suggestions for accelerated task improvements.
Furthermore, our state of the art priority algorithm provides a ordered list of tasks to do next so users can avoid struggling to meet deadlines.

## Setup

To run the client application, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Once installed, the following commands should yield a similar version:

```sh
$ node -v

$ npm -v
