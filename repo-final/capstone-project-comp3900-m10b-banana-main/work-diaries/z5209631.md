Week 1
**Meeting 1**
We assigned scrum master: Taimoor Shabih
Set up when2meet for future meetings (Friday 12pm)
Set up JIRA

**Self Work**
Tasked to generate 2 novelty    tionalities: 
1. An algorithm which uses a combined score based on deadlines, priorty, buffers, etc to create a priority list
- This would be something like a page rank tailored to each individual based off their own tasks and priorities
- Parameters could include: deadlines, priority, estimated time taken, buffer, blockers

2. Self-reflection functionality which tracks how much time allocated to a task, how long it actually took and user can record how they performed as well as feedback to see if the length of the task was too long/short/just right
- Essentially a self tracker which could provide feedback on how the individual spends their time and display ways of improvement

**Meeting 2**
Discusssed ideas and narrowed it down to 6 and sent off to tutor:
1. gamification of the tasks (see below)
2. some sort of data visualisation tool (pie chart etc.) to show task allocations, taskmaster availability status, and other important information
3. an algorithm which uses a combined score based on deadlines, priorty, buffers, etc to create a priority list
4. self-reflection functionality which tracks how much time allocated to a task, how long it actually took and user can record how they performed as well as feedback to see if the length of the task was too long/short/just right
5. request help feature
6. categorise tasks using colour coded tags for similar tasks

Week 2
**Meeting 1**
- Get github setup
- work on use stories: 2 novel functionalities assigned to me
- Wrote meeting minutes
- fleshed out novel funcationalities 

User Stories:
As a [persona], I [want to], [so that]
Priority Algorithm:
As a task master, I want to be able to clearly outline my priorities such that there is a clear order I should do my tasks in so that it takes away the stresses of organizing tasks in real time.
As a manager, I want to be able to see an organized priority list of each subordinate so that I have better insight into what they are working on and the expected delivery.

Self-reflection:
As a task master, I want to be able to track my career progress and how changes I have made affected my efficiency so that I am able to adapt and improve my work strategies.

**Meeting 2**
- Put user stories on JIRA and discussed feedback on submitted stories
- work on acceptance criteria for novel functionalities
- Set up basic git files

Acceptance Criteria:
Priority Algorithm:
As a task master, I want to be able to clearly outline my priorities such that there is a clear order I should do my tasks in so that it takes away the stresses of organizing tasks in real time.
As a manager, I want to be able to see an organized priority list of each subordinate so that I have better insight into what they are working on and the expected delivery.

Scenario - Sort prioritized list
Given -  The user nagivates to the task board
When - The user sorts by prioritized list
Then - The system orders the tasks in order of personalised highest priority to least
And -


Self-reflection:
As a task master, I want to be able to track my career progress and how changes I have made affected my efficiency so that I am able to adapt and improve my work strategies.

Scenario - Generate self-reflection report
Given - The user navigates to profile
When - The user selects "generate feedback report"
Then -  The system displays a webpage revealing progress of the user
And -

Week 3
**Meeting 1**
- Decided on product name: Tuesday
- Push work diary to github
- Discussed system architecture 
    - offered python, flask, datetime, plotly suggestions
- Work on backend and database system architecture modules
- Add acceptance criteria to Jira
- Complete storyboards

Completed storyboards

**Meeting 2**
- Finalised system architecture
- Reviewed storyboards and took feedback
- Reviewed and sorted user story 

- Apply feedback to storyboards
- write sentences which capture the functionality of the user stories
- Add novel functionality research to proposal

As a task master, I want to be able to clearly outline my priorities such that there is a clear order I should do my tasks in so that it takes away the stresses of organizing tasks in real time.
- Algorithm will only sort tasks assigned to the current user
- The algorithm will update as tasks are updated
- The algorithm will update at the start of each day 


As a manager, I want to be able to see an organized priority list of each subordinate so that I have better insight into what they are working on and the expected delivery.
- A user can view a compiled priority list of every user


Self-reflection:
As a task master, I want to be able to track my career progress and how changes I have made affected my efficiency so that I am able to adapt and improve my work strategies.
- A user is able to view their efficiency graphically
- A user is able to give feedback after a task
- A user can graphically view their progress over a requested time period
- A user is able to view and tick off a compiled feedback list

**Meeting 3**
- Discussed acceptance criteria and previous meetings' agenda items
- Research MongoDB 
- Branching convention for backend is: "backend_[branch name]
- Finish all incomplete proposal tasks
- Format proposal
- Start working on code

Backend:
- Use python OOP functionalities
- Two main classes are the Task and User classes

Proposal:
Function 9
This user story allows task masters the opportunity to filter tasks in a page rank style to order their tasks in an order which they should complete it in accounting for personalised buffers, estimated time to complete tasks, deadlines, and blockers. The second user story also allows task masters to observe the priority rankings of other task masters to observe when potential blockers and tasks will be resolved. This ranking will be displayed as a list on the task page for the current task master and on the profile subpage for other task masters. This functionality is novel as when compared to similar task management systems it is able to sort tasks in a personalised way for the user which no other task management system has done before. 

Function 10
This user story allows task masters to condense feedback from completed tasks and view it summarised and graphically on their profile page. Specifically, task masters are able to view graphically their feedback on past tasks through enjoyability, progression, time taken on tasks, as well as comparisons to other task masters. Task masters are also able to provide goals at the end of tasks and check it off when reflecting on themselves for improvement. This is a novel functionality as it provides a medium for users to reflect and consolidate feedback and lessons from completed tasks which no other task management system offers. 

Week 4

- Assigned functionality - I am doing priority sort

**Meeting 2**
- Met as a team to discuss the functionalities discussed as backend
- Refactored code with Eric
- Fleshed out priority sort

**Priority Sort**
Variables:
- Priority
- Hours Remaining (deadline)
- Estimated Hours 
- Buffer = avg(sum(t_complete - t_progress))
- Blockers

First - generate earliest and latest start range for each task
Blocking tasks use recursion

Priority List = Priority * (h_est + h_buf -(t_now - t_progress))/h_remaining

Move tasks within priority list depending on weather it fits the start range.

note:
if h_remaining <= 0:
    h_remaining = 0.001
elif h_remaining = '':
    h_remaining = 2000 (roughly number of working hours in a year rounded up)

If a task has a blocker, cannot add a child of the blocker as another blocker

**Meeting 3**
