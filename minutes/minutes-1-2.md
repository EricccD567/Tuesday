## Agenda Items

1. Eric's ideas
    1. Idea 1: able to track and record live hours worked on tasks, adding a pomodoro timer to improve productivity
    2. Idea 2: create an onboarding step by step experience for new users that allows them to create a task and add and assign other users
    2. **Idea 3**: gamification of the tasks (see below)
2. Taimoor's ideas
    1. Idea 1: sort tasks into categories
    2. Idea 2: commenting functionality for each task
    3. Idea 3: toggle light/dark mode
    4. **Idea 4**: some sort of data visualisation tool (pie chart etc.) to show task allocations, taskmaster availability status, and other important information
3. Luke's ideas
    1. **Idea 1**: an algorithm which uses a combined score based on deadlines, priorty, buffers, etc to create a priority list
    2. **Idea 2**: self-reflection functionality which tracks how much time allocated to a task, how long it actually took and user can record how they performed as well as feedback to see if the length of the task was too long/short/just right
4. Kevin's ideas
    1. Idea 1: commenting functionality
    2. Idea 2: frontend priority highlighting
